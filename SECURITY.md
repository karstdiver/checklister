# SECURITY.md

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in <app_name>, please report it responsibly. You can do so by:

1. Creating a private GitHub issue (if repository permissions allow),
2. Contacting the project maintainer directly via email (preferred for sensitive vulnerabilities).

Please include the following details:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

We commit to investigating all reports and responding within a reasonable timeframe.

## Security Practices

The <app_name> project incorporates the following security principles:

- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
- Secure-by-default configurations
- Use of .env files to protect secrets
- Regular dependency review and updates
- Separation of frontend and backend concerns

## Dependencies

Dependencies are regularly reviewed via automated tools and manually updated. Developers should use:
```bash
npm audit fix
flutter pub outdated
pip list --outdated
```

## Authentication & Authorization

Authentication and access control are implemented (or planned) with role-based access mechanisms for users, testers, and admins.

## Infrastructure

This project avoids hard-coded credentials. Ensure `.env` files are never committed to version control. Configuration is managed using:
- `docker-compose.yml`
- environment variables
- secure vaults (planned)

## Disclaimer

This project is under active development. Please do not use it in production environments without proper security review and testing.

## Development Security Approach
Manage third-party risk
So, you’ve implemented best practices across your development environment, but what about your supply chain vendors? Applications are only as secure as their weakest links. Software ecosystems today are interconnected and complex. Third-party libraries, frameworks, cloud services, and open-source components all represent prime entry points for attackers.

A software bill of materials (SBOM) can help you understand what’s under the hood, providing a detailed inventory of application components and libraries to identify potential vulnerabilities. But that’s just the beginning, because development practices can also introduce supply chain risk.

To reduce third-party risk:

Validate software as artifacts move through build pipelines to make sure it hasn’t been compromised.
Use version-specific containers for open-source components to support traceability.
Ensure pipelines validate code and packages before use, especially from third-party repositories.
Securing the software supply chain means assuming every dependency could be compromised.

The project will support a commitment to continuous monitoring of security relevant items.

Application security is a moving target. Tools, threats, dependencies, and even the structure of your teams evolve. Your security posture should evolve with them. To keep pace, organizations need an ongoing monitoring and improvement program that includes:

Regular reviews and updates to secure development practices,
Role-specific training for everyone across the SDLC,
Routine audits of code reviews, access controls, and remediation workflows, and
Penetration testing and red teaming, wherever appropriate.
