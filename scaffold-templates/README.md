# Placeholder for README.md in scaffold-templates directory

The directory called scaffold-templates is not required for your Level 3/4 Checklister app to function—but it can be very helpful depending on how you're managing repetitive development tasks.

✅ What Is scaffold-templates?
A scaffold-templates directory typically contains boilerplate code templates used to quickly generate:

UI screens

StateNotifiers or NotifierProviders

Firebase service wrappers

Tests

Localization files

It's a developer productivity tool, not a runtime dependency.

🎯 In the Context of Level 3/4 Architecture
Level 3/4 Flutter Clean Architecture emphasizes strict separation of layers:

css
Copy
Edit
lib/
 └── src/
     ├── presentation/
     ├── application/
     ├── domain/
     └── infrastructure/
scaffold-templates does not belong inside lib/src/, and it's not deployed with the app. It can live at the root level or in a tools/ directory and is used for development scaffolding only.

✅ When You Might Want It
Use a scaffold-templates/ directory if:

You or your team want consistent file creation (e.g., NewChecklistItemScreen, ChecklistItemNotifier)

You're using tools like:

mason (Dart code generator)

custom shell scripts to cp and rename templates

🚫 When You Don’t Need It
If you're not automating template generation.

If your team prefers manually creating files and copying patterns.
