# Makefile for automating tasks

# Purpose of this Makefile
# A Makefile at the top level of your project is typically used to standardize and simplify common development, testing, build, and deployment tasks across all team members â€” regardless of platform or role.

# It works by defining shortcut commands (called "targets") that can run complex shell commands with simple instructions like:

install:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

# Makefile for iPlanning project
