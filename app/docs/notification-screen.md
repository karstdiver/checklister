## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
app/lib/features/settings/presentation/notification_screen.dart
```

### Key Components

1. **NotificationScreen**: Main screen widget with tier-based feature access
2. **Feature Guards**: Protect premium features with upgrade encouragement
3. **Curious User Method**: Shows locked features with upgrade prompts

### Privilege Integration

The notification features are integrated into the user tier system:

```dart
// In user_tier.dart
'basicNotifications': true,        // All tiers
'reminderNotifications': true,     // All tiers
'progressNotifications': true,     // Free+
'achievementNotifications': true,  // Free+
'weeklyReports': true,            // Premium+
'customReminders': true,          // Premium+
'smartSuggestions': true,         // Premium+
'teamNotifications': true,        // Pro only
```

### Feature Guards

Specific feature guards are available for notification features:

- `WeeklyReportsGuard`
- `CustomRemindersGuard`
- `SmartSuggestionsGuard`
- `TeamNotificationsGuard`

### Curious User Implementation

When users don't have access to a feature, they see:

1. **Locked Feature Display**: Shows the feature name with a lock icon
2. **Description**: Explains what the feature does
3. **SignupEncouragement**: Provides upgrade/signup options

### Navigation

The notification screen is accessible from:
- Settings screen → Notifications
- Profile edit screen → Notifications

Route: `/notifications`

## Implementation Details

### Save Functionality

The notification screen now properly saves user preferences:

1. **NotificationSettingsProvider**: Manages state and persistence
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are reflected immediately in the UI
3. **Persistent Storage**: Settings are saved to Firestore user preferences
4. **Error Handling**: Shows error messages if saving fails
5. **Loading States**: Save button shows loading indicator during save operation

### Data Structure

Notification settings are stored in the user's preferences document:

```json
{
  "preferences": {
    "notificationSettings": {
      "basicNotificationsEnabled": true,
      "reminderNotificationsEnabled": false,
      "progressNotificationsEnabled": false,
      "achievementNotificationsEnabled": false,
      "weeklyReportsEnabled": false,
      "customRemindersEnabled": false,
      "smartSuggestionsEnabled": false,
      "teamNotificationsEnabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Push Notification Integration**: Implement actual push notifications
2. **Custom Schedules**: Allow users to set custom notification times
3. **Notification History**: Show past notifications
4. **Bulk Actions**: Enable/disable multiple notification types at once
5. **Notification Templates**: Predefined notification schedules

## Testing

The notification screen can be tested by:
1. Running the app with different user tiers
2. Verifying feature access based on privilege level
3. Testing the curious user encouragement flow
4. Validating navigation from settings and profile screens
